# Rock-Paper-Scissors-
Repo for an interactive rock,paper,scissors game!

This is my first project using HTML/CSS and JavaScript!

I have created a game of rock,paper,scissors that will last till either the player or the computer has won 5 rounds. For now, the game is played in the console tab of developer tools. To play, right-click and inspect the page. Then open the console tab. Refresh the page and then add your choices for rock paper scissors in the prompt that pops up! You will be playing against the computer that makes random choices on its own as well.

Through this project I learned:
1) how to write and link JS scripts
2) how to work with nested loops and conditional operators
3) creating functions from scratch

Good luck and I hope you enjoy this game!
